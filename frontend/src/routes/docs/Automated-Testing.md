Automated Testing Documentation
Introduction

Automated testing is a crucial practice in software development that involves using tools and scripts to automatically execute test cases, validate software functionality, and detect defects early in the development process. This documentation provides an overview of different types of automated testing, including unit testing with pytest, load testing with Locust, and API testing with cURL.

1. Unit Testing with Pytest
   What is Pytest?

Pytest is a widely used testing framework for writing simple and scalable test cases in Python. It provides easy-to-use syntax and powerful features for writing and executing tests.
Writing Unit Tests with Pytest

To write unit tests with pytest, follow these steps:

    Install pytest:

bash

pip install pytest

    Write test functions using the assert statement to verify expected outcomes.

    Save the test functions in files prefixed with test_ or suffixed with _test.py.

    Run pytest in the terminal to execute the tests:

bash

pytest

Example:

python

# test_math_functions.py

def test_addition():
assert 2 + 2 == 4

def test_subtraction():
assert 5 - 3 == 2

2. Load Testing with Locust
   What is Locust?

Locust is an open-source load testing tool written in Python. It allows you to define user behavior as code and simulate thousands of concurrent users to test the performance of your web applications.
Writing Load Tests with Locust

To write load tests with Locust, follow these steps:

    Install Locust:

bash

pip install locust

    Define user behavior as tasks within a Python class subclassed from HttpUser.

    Run Locust in the terminal:

bash

locust -f my_load_test.py

    Access the Locust web interface to configure the number of users and hatch rate, then start the test.

Example:

python

# my_load_test.py

from locust import HttpUser, between, task

class MyUser(HttpUser):
wait_time = between(1, 2)

    @task
    def my_task(self):
        self.client.get("/my-endpoint")

3. API Testing with cURL
   What is cURL?

cURL is a command-line tool for transferring data using various protocols. It is commonly used for testing APIs by sending HTTP requests and inspecting responses.
Writing API Tests with cURL

To write API tests with cURL, follow these steps:

    Construct HTTP requests using cURL commands in the terminal.

    Send requests to API endpoints and analyze the responses.

Example:

bash

# Send a GET request to retrieve user data

curl http://api.example.com/users/123

# Send a POST request to create a new user

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username": "john", "email": "john@example.com"}' http://api.example.com/users

Conclusion

Automated testing, including unit testing, load testing, and API testing, plays a vital role in ensuring the quality and reliability of software applications. By leveraging tools like pytest, Locust, and cURL, developers can automate testing processes, identify defects early, and deliver high-quality software products efficiently. Use the guidelines provided in this documentation to implement effective automated testing strategies in your development workflow.
