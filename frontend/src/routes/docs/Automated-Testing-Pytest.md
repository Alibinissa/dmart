## Automated Testing Documentation using Pytest

**Introduction**

Automated testing is a critical aspect of software development, ensuring that changes to code do not inadvertently introduce bugs or regressions. Pytest is a widely-used testing framework for Python that allows developers to write simple and scalable tests. This documentation provides guidelines and examples for automated testing using Pytest in the context of a FastAPI application.

**Setting Up**
Before writing tests, ensure that your environment is properly configured for testing. You will need:

- Python environment with Pytest installed
- FastAPI application with appropriate endpoints

- Test client for making HTTP requests to the FastAPI application

- Redis and plugin manager configurations (if applicable)

**Writing Tests**

Pytest follows a simple syntax for writing tests, using functions prefixed with test\_. These functions contain assertions that verify the expected behavior of your code.

**Example Test File Structure**
<img class="center" src={pytest-exmple} width="500">

**Example Test Functions**
<img class="center" src={pytest-function} width="500">

**Test Setup and Teardown**

Pytest allows you to define setup and teardown functions using the setup_method and teardown_method decorators. These functions run before and after each test function, respectively.

<img class="center" src={pytest-setup} width="500">
 
**Example Assertion Functions**

Pytest provides various assertion functions to validate test outcomes. Some common assertions include:

- assert response.status_code == 200: Verify HTTP status code
- assert response.json()['status'] == 'success': Verify JSON response
  attributes
- assert 'error' not in response.json(): Verify absence of errors

**Running Tests**

To run tests using Pytest, navigate to the directory containing your test files and run the following command:
<img class="center" src={pytest-run.png} width="500">

Pytest will automatically discover and execute all test functions within the directory.

**Conclusion**

Automated testing with Pytest offers a robust framework for verifying the correctness of your FastAPI applications. By following the guidelines outlined in this documentation, you can ensure the reliability and stability of your codebase through comprehensive test coverage.
